16S rRNA and 18S rRNA data analysis of rib bones collected from three spring and three summer bodies placed at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science facility.

Analysis was conducted using QIIME2 software and R. Raw data are available at https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/11553.

Abstract:
The bones of decomposing vertebrates are colonized by a succession of diverse microbial communities. If this succession is similar across individuals, the microbes may provide clues about the postmortem interval (PMI) during forensic investigations in which human skeletal remains are discovered. In this study we characterize the human bone microbial decomposer community to determine whether microbial succession can serve as a marker for PMI. Six human donor subjects were placed outdoors to decompose on the soil surface at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science facility. To also assess the effect of seasons, three decedents were placed each in the spring and summer. Once ribs were exposed through natural decomposition, a rib was collected from each body for eight time points at three weeks apart. We discovered a core bone decomposer microbiome dominated by taxa in the phylum Proteobacteria, and evidence that these bone-invading microbes are likely sourced from the surrounding decomposition environment, including skin of the cadaver and soils. Additionally, we found significant overall differences in bone microbial community composition between seasons. Finally, we used the microbial community data to develop random forest models that predict PMI with an accuracy of approximately +/-34 days over a 1â€“9-month time frame of decomposition. Typically, anthropologists provide PMI estimates based on qualitative information, which gives PMI errors ranging from several months to years. This is the first known data-driven, quantitative PMI estimate of skeletal remains using microbial abundance information, and it would be a useful contribution to forensic investigations.
